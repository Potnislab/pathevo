## Summary


* The evolving threat of new pathogen variants in future climatic conditions poses a risk to modern agricultural systems, compromising durability of host resistance.  
* Here, resistant and susceptible pepper genotypes were inoculated with two closely related strains of *Xanthomonas perforans*, and within-host pathogen adaptation was monitored in open-top chambers under stressors of host defense and elevated Ozone (O<sub>3</sub>).  
* Elevated O<sub>3</sub> led to increased disease severity with higher variability on the resistant cultivar but not on the susceptible cultivar. Susceptible cultivar showed a prevalence of a single pathogen genotype across environments. On the other hand, pathogen population heterogeneity observed on resistant cultivar was accompanied by de novo mutations with signatures of parallel evolution. Altered (O<sub>3</sub>) levels led to strain turnover on resistant cultivar with greater contribution of allele shifts towards within-host polymorphism. Elevated O3 supported random de novo mutations that led to higher degree of polymorphism indicative of transient mutations. 
*	While population heterogeneity is a mechanism as response to stressors, parallel de novo mutations from a single growing season in response to quantitative resistance may provide clues to predicting long-term pathogen evolution. Presence of high proportion of transient mutations with lack of parallel mutations suggest less predictable pathogen evolution under abiotic stress.
